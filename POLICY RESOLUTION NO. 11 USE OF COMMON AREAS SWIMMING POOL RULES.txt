USE OF COMMON AREAS: SWIMMING POOL RULES
relating to Rules and Regulations for pool usage by Stratford Court and Stratford House Residents
WHEREAS, Article 3, Section 3.1 of the Bylaws states that "TI1e Board of Directors shall have all of the powers and duties necessary for the administration of the affairs of the Unit Owners Association and may do all such acts and things as are not by the Condominium Act, or the Condominium instruments required to be exercised and done by the Association;" and
WHEREAS, for the health, safety, comfort and convenience of all owners and residents, the Board wishes to establish rules and regulations governing the use of the Association's swimming pools;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT the following Rules and Regulations for use of the swimming pools be adopted:
I. RIGHT TO USE POOL
1.          All Members of the Association ( or their designated tenants) are entitled to use the swimming pool facility designated for their building. This privilege may be suspended by the Board of Directors for Members who are delinquent in their assessment payments for a period in excess of sixty (60) days. Members who lease their unit must designate, in writing, using a form authorized by the Association, those tenants living in the unit who are entitled to use the swimming pool. A non-resident member who leases his unit is not entitled to use of the pool.
2.           A facilities pass will be issued to all Members, members of their families residing in the unit, and designated tenants of Members, age two and over. A facilities pass will not be issued to any Member or other eligible pool user unless all assessment fees or other charges owed to the Association are paid in full. Only those persons with a valid facilities pass shall be entitled to use the swimming pool. Facilities passes will be issued or validated on an annual basis prior to the beginning of the swimming season. There will be a charge for any replacement facilities pass, the amount of which shall be established by the Board of Directors. Facilities passes are the property of the Association and are for the exclusive use of residents of the Stratford Condominium. Separate facilities passes shall be issued for residents of Stratford House and Stratford Court. The passes are not transferable and may be suspended by the Association for violations of the Association's legal documents or rules and regulations, as well as improper conduct with respect to the use of the pool, as referenced in paragraph II., below.
3.          Guests must be escorted by an eligible pool user with a valid facilities pass who is sixteen years of age or older. Guests will not be admitted to the pool without such escort. All guests must register with the pool manager prior to entering the pool. The conduct of guests is the responsibility of the escort.
4.          The Board of Directors may, from time to time, establish rules with respect to guest privileges, including the number of guests that may be admitted and fees, if any, for such guests. Until the Board establishes rules to the contrary, an eligible pool user sixteen years of age or older may bring a maximum of two guests at any time. Furthermore, there will be a maximum of four guests admitted at any time per eligible user household.
II. RULES FOR USE OF THE POOL
1.           The Association is represented by the managers and lifeguards, who have been instructed in the rules of the pool. Any conflicts shall be addressed with the pool manager, or assistant manager, who will bring the issue to the Association if it cannot be satisfactorily resolved.
2.           Certified lifeguards will be on duty at all times that the pool is open. They have the authority to use their discretion to enforce the rules to maintain a safe and healthy environment. The manager is in charge of the pool and is there for the protection of persons using the pool. The manager has the authority to ask anyone to leave the pool area for infractions of the rules or when safety is threatened. The manager may prohibit entry to anyone for up to one week for each violation without prior authorization from the Board of Directors.
3.          Safety is of primary concern to the Association and its Members. All persons using the pool do so at their own risk and agree to abide by the rules for use of the facility. The Association assumes no responsibility for any accident or injury in connection with such use or for any loss or damage to personal property. Residents (Members and tenants) are responsible for the actions of their children and guests.
4.           Children under twelve (12) years of age must be accompanied by a responsible person sixteen (I 6) years of age or older while in the pool area.
5.           No person shall use the pool facilities unless the pool is officially open and lifeguards are on duty. Unauthorized persons found inside the pool enclosure when the pool is closed will lose their privileges for the remainder of the summer and risk prosecution for trespassing.
6.           All bathers shall take a shower bath using soap and warm water and thoroughly rinsing off before entering the pool. (Parents are encouraged to instruct their children).
7.           Persons who have obvious infections (colds, lesions, open sores, etc.) will not be allowed in the pool. Sanitary habits are a responsibility of everyone and anyone displaying improper behavior will be asked to leave the pool area.
8.          Cigarette smoking will be permitted only in areas, if any, specifically designated for this purpose by the Board of Directors. No smoking is permitted in the bath house facility.

22.           During the last ten minutes of every hour, all persons under the age of sixteen (16) are required to stay out of the pool for a safety break and to permit exclusive use by persons age sixteen (16) and over.
