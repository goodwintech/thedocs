1.  The Board of Directors approves a proposed capital improvement plan to acquire and install an irrigation (water sprinkler) system for the cost-effective maintenance of the Association's lawns and landscape plantings on its common elements;
2.  The proposed 1rngation system is not to exceed $110,000 in acquisition and installation costs, based upon the Association's specifications and the contractors' competitive bids. These costs are to be financed initially from the Association's reserve accounts.

PROPOSED IRRIGATION SYSTEM
Fact Sheet
• Stratford's developer planned but did not install an irrigation or water sprinkler system. In 2005, the Association was compensated for amenity projects that were not completed.
• In 2005, the Environmental Committee reported wide-spread losses of trees, shrubs, and other plantings, caused in part by irrigation and drainage problems. Board authorized $15,000 to replace priority plantings and $30,000 to develop a master landscape plan to correct problems and enhance property.
• Landscape architect recommends installing an irrigation system to support landscape improvements.
• Environmental Committee received 5 competitive proposals for a property wide irrigation system. While the Board approved financing not to exceed $110,000, the system is now expected to cost about $99,000 with a discount incentive for installation after October 1.
• Acquisition costs will be "borrowed" from the Common Area Reserve & Replacement Fund. This capital improvement costs an average of $290 per unit ($99,000/340 units). Actual cost shares, however, will vary based on each unit's par value.
• The R&R Fund will be "repaid" in four, annual installments of $24,750 beginning in 2007. This annual "repayment" will average $75 per unit, about $6.50 each month.
• Since the irrigation system will be an addition to our capital structures, we will have to budget for its future replacement costs over an expected life is 20 years. Annual deposits to the R&R Fund will average $15 per unit, or about $1.25 each month. Inflationary adjustments may have to be made to cover future costs.
• Hand watering done by the Association and by Brickman, our landscape contractor costs approximately $6,000 per year. The cost comparison is $6,000 vs. $99,000 for the irrigation system.
• Annual maintenance costs are estimated about $2,000 to cover normal wear-and-tear expenses, such as replacing sprinkler heads and repairing leaks in the underground pipes. This is less than our current costs for manual watering with hoses and trucks. Also, our maintenance staff will be directed to other needed projects during the summer months.
• The Board of Directors and the Environmental Committee believe that the proposed irrigation system is a capital investment that will help preserve our unique landscaping assets and enhance our property values.
