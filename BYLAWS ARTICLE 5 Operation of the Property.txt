Section 5.1. Determination of Common Expenses and Assessments Against Unit Owners.
(a)              Fiscal Year. The fiscal year of the Unit Owners Association shall be the calendar year unless otherwise deter-mined by the Board of Directors.
(b)              Preparation and Approval of Budget.
(1)              At least seventy-five days before the beginning of each fiscal year, the Board of Directors shall adopt a budget for the Association containing an estimate of the total amount considered necessary to pay the cost of maintenance, management, operation, repair and replacement of the common elements and those parts of the units as to which it is the responsibility of the Association to maintain, repair and replace, and the cost of wages, materials, insurance premiums, services, supplies and other expenses that may be declared to be common expenses by the Condominium Act, the condominium instruments or a resolution of the Association and which will be required during the ensuing fiscal year for the administration, operation, maintenance and repair of the Property and the rendering to the unit owners of all related services. The budget shall also reflect the separate assessment of Limited Common Expenses including without limitation certain expenses relating to each Ward, as set forth in subsection (h).
(2)              Such budget shall also include such reasonable amounts as the Board of Directors considers necessary to provide working capital, a general operating reserve and reserves for contingencies and replacements. At least sixty-five days before the beginning of each fiscal year, the Board of Directors shall send to each unit owner a copy of the budget in a reasonably itemized form which sets forth the amount of the com­mon expenses and any special assessment payable by each unit owner. Such budget shall constitute the basis for determining each unit owner's assessment for the common expenses of the Condominium.
(c)     Assessment and Payment of Common Expenses.
(1)              Subject to the provisions of Section 9.1 (a), the total amount of the estimated funds required from assessments for the operation of the Property set forth In the budget adopted by the Board of Directors shall be assessed against each unit owner in proportion to such unit owner's respective Common Element Interest, except for: (i) Limited Common Expenses, which shall be assessed against each unit owner benefited in proportion to the relative Common Element Interest of such units inter se, or in accordance with use of the services, as appropriate, and (ii) expenses payable by owners of Stratford House units only or Stratford Courts units only, which shall be assessed against the units benefited in proportion to the relative Ward Share of such units, inter se, as provided in subsection (h). The assessment for common expenses, including Limited Common Expenses, shall be a lien against each unit owner's unit as provided in Section 9.2. On or before the first day of each fiscal year, and the first day of each of the succeeding eleven months in such fiscal year, each unit owner shall be obligated to pay to the Board of Directors or the managing agent (as determined by the Board), one-twelfth of such assessment. Within ninety days after the end of each fiscal year, the Board of Directors shall supply to all unit owners, and to each Mortgagee requesting the same, an itemized accounting of the common expenses for such fiscal year actually incurred and paid, together with a tabulation of the amounts collected pursuant to the budget adopted by the Board of Directors for such fiscal year, and showing the net amount over or short of the actual expenditures plus reserves. Any amount accumulated in excess of the amount required for actual expenses and reserves shall, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, be placed in reserve accounts, be placed in a special account to be expended solely for the general welfare of the unit owners, be credited according to each unit owner's Common Element Interest to the next periodic installments due from unit owners under the current fiscal year's budget, until exhausted, or distributed to the unit owners. Unless the Board of Directors directs otherwise, any net shortage shall be assessed promptly against the unit owners in accordance with their Common Element Interests and shall be payable either. (1) in full with payment of the next periodic assessment which is due more than ten days after delivery of notice of such further assessment; or (2) in not more than six equal periodic installments, as the Board of Directors may determine.
(2)              Any common expenses paid or incurred in making available the same off-site amenities or paid subscription television service to some or all of the unit owners shall be assessed equally against the condominium units involved, and any common expenses paid or incurred in providing metered utility services to some or all of the units shall be assessed against each condominium unit involved based on its actual consumption of such services. Any common expenses benefiting less than all of the condominium units, or caused by the conduct of less than all those entitled to occupy the same or by their licensees or invitees, shall be specially assessed against the condominium unit or units involved, in proportion to their respective Common Element Interests. Any common expenses paid or incurred in providing metered utility services to some or all of the units shall be assessed against each condominium unit involved based on its actual consumption of such services. Further, the Board of Directors may assess other expenses on other bases to the extent permitted by section 55-79.83 of the Condominium Act.
 
(d)      Reserves. The Board of Directors shall build up and maintain reasonable reserves for working capital, operations (including losses due to insurance deductibles), contingencies and replacements. Reserves for items serving only one Ward shall be maintained for and funded solely by (as a Limited Common Expense) the units in such Ward. Such reserves shall be maintained and funded separately from reserves for items serving all units. The replacement reserve shall include funds necessary for the reconstruction of the on-site underground stormwater detention facility. Extraordinary expenditures not originally included in the annual budget which may become necessary during the year shall be charged first against such reserves. Except for normal maintenance expenses shown in the annual operating budget, all expenses for repair and replacement of physical assets maintained by the Association shall be charged first against such reserves. Unless otherwise determined by a vote of three-fourths of the directors, the amount held as reserves shall not substantially exceed the amount reasonably required to assure the Association's ability to replace components as they reach the end of their useful lives. If regular annual maintenance extends the useful life of components so that reserves are excessive, the reserves shall be adjusted by reallocation to other budget items or by distribution to the unit owners. If the reserves are inadequate for any reason, including non-payment of any unit owner's assessment, the Board of Directors may at any time levy a further assessment, which shall be assessed against the unit owners according to their respective Common Element Interests, and which may be payable in a lump sum or in installments as the Board may determine. The Board of Directors shall serve notice of any such further assessment on unit owners by a statement in writing giving the amount and reasons therefor, and such further assessment shall, unless otherwise specified in the notice, become effective with the next periodic payment which is due more than ten days after the delivery of such notice of further assessment All unit owners so notified shall be obligated to pay the adjusted periodic amount or, if such further assessment is not payable in installments, the amount of such assessment. Such assessment shall be a lien as of the effective date as set forth in subsection (c).
(e)              Initial Budget and Initial Capital Payment. (i) Upon taking office, the first Board of Directors elected or designated pursuant to these Bylaws shall determine the budget, as defined in this section, for the period commencing thirty days after such election and ending on the last day of the fiscal year in which such election occurs. Assessments shall be levied and become a lien against the unit owners during such period as provided in subsection (c).
(ii) The Declarant, as the agent of the Board of Directors, will collect from each initial purchaser at the time of settlement an "initial capital payment" equivalent to twice the estimated periodic installment of the annual assessment for common expenses and limited common element parking space charges, if any, for such purchaser's unit. The Declarant will deliver the funds so collected to the Board of Directors to provide the necessary working capital for the Association. Such funds may be used for certain prepaid Items, initial equipment, supplies, organizational costs and other start-up costs, and for such other purposes as the Board of Directors may determine.
(f)               Effect of Failure to Prepare or Adopt Budget. The failure or delay of the Board of Directors to prepare or adopt a budget for any fiscal year shall not constitute a waiver or release in any manner of a unit owner's obligation to pay the allocable share of the common expenses as provided in these Bylaws whenever the same shall be determined and, in the absence of any annual budget or adjusted budget, each unit owner shall continue to pay each periodic installment at the rate established for the previous fiscal year until notified of the periodic payment which is due more than ten days after such new annual or adjusted budget is adopted.
(g)              Accounts. All sums collected by the Board of Directors with respect to assessments against the unit owners or from any other source may be commingled into a single fund.
 
(h)              Expenses Payable by Unit Owners Within A Ward Only. Pursuant to subsection (c), certain expenses and reserves benefiting units in one Ward only shall be assessed against units in that Ward only. Such expenses and reserves shall include without limitation those expenses arising from the operation, maintenance, repair and replacement of the limited common elements in each Ward and the following expenses and reserves and such other expenses and reserves -as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine by unanimous vote: secretarial service, janitorial supplies, electricity, natural gas, elevators and master television antenna or cable system. Such expenses shall be Limited Common Expenses assessed against each unit owner of a unit in a Ward in proportion to such unit's relative Common Element Interest of all units in that Ward inter se as shown on the Common Element Interest Table, Exhibit C to the Declaration.
 
Section 5.2. Payment of Common Expenses. Each unit owner shall pay the common expenses, Including Limited Common Expenses, assessed by the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.1. No unit owner may be exempted from liability for the assessment for common expenses by reason of waiver of the use or enjoyment of any of the common elements or by abandonment of the unit. No unit owner shall be liable for the payment of any part of the common expenses assessed against that unit sub­sequent to the date of recordation of a conveyance by such unit owner in fee of such unit. Prior to or at the time of any such conveyance, all liens, unpaid charges and assessments shall be paid in full and discharged. The purchaser of a unit shall be jointly and severally liable with the selling unit owner for all unpaid assessments against the latter for the proportionate share of the common expenses up to the time of such recordation, without prejudice to the purchaser's right to recover from the selling unit owner amounts paid by the purchaser therefor; provided, however, that any such purchaser shall be entitled to a statement setting forth the amount of the unpaid assessments against the selling unit owner within ten days following a written request therefor to the Board of Directors or managing agent and such purchaser shall not be liable for, nor shall the unit conveyed be subject to a lien for, any unpaid assessments in excess of the amount therein set forth; and provided, further, that each Mortgagee who comes into possession of a condominium unit by virtue of foreclosure or by deed or assignment in lieu of foreclosure, or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale, shall take the condominium unit free of any claims for unpaid assessments or charges against such unit which accrue prior to the time such Mortgagee or purchaser comes into possession thereof, except for claims for a pro rata share of such assessments or charges resulting from a pro rata reallocation of such assessments or charges to all condominium units including the mortgaged condominium unit.
Section 5.3. Collection of Assessments. The Board of Directors, or the managing agent at the request of the Board, shall take prompt action to collect any assessments for common expenses due from any unit owner which remain unpaid for more than thirty days after the due date.

Any assessment, or installment thereof, not paid within fifteen days after due shall accrue a late charge in the amount of twenty-five dollars, or such other amount as may be established from time to time by the Board of Directors.
Section 5.4. Statement of Common Expenses. The Board of Directors shall promptly.. provide any unit owner, contract purchaser or Mortgagee so requesting the same in writing with a written statement of all unpaid assessments for common expenses due from such unit owner.

Except during the Declarant Control Period, whenever in the judgment of the Board of Directors the common elements shall require additions, alterations or improvements costing in excess of ten percent of the total annual assessment for common expenses for that fiscal year during any period of twelve consecutive months, the making of such additions, alterations or improvements requires a Majority Vote, and the Board of Directors shall assess all unit owners benefited for the cost thereof as a common expense (or Limited Common Expense). Any additions, alterations or improvements costing less than ten percent of the total annual assessment for common expenses for that fiscal year during any period of twelve consecutive months may be made by the Board of Directors without approval of the unit owners and the cost thereof shall constitute a common expense or Limited Common Expense, depending on the nature of the additions, alterations or improvements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, in the opinion of not less than eighty percent of the directors, such additions, alterations or improvements are exclusively or substantially exclusively for the benefit of the unit owners requesting the same, such requesting unit owners shall be assessed therefor in such proportion as they jointly approve or, if they are unable to agree thereon, in such proportion as may be determined by the Board of Directors.
