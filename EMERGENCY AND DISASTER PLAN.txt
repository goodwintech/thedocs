EMERGENCY AND DISASTER PLAN


Dear Homeowner:
Emergencies and disasters are unpredictable and can strike quickly and without
warning. They can force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your
home. Local officials and relief workers will be on the scene after a disaster, but they
cannot reach everyone right away. What would you do if basic services like water, gas,
electricity or telephones were cut off? Do you have a plan?
In most emergency situations, the actions taken in the first few minutes are the
most critical. It is important that you are prepared to act in a swift, calm, and disciplined
manner should a disaster occur. Accordingly, you need to develop a comprehensive
emergency plan that anticipates all disasters.
A basic emergency plan is being provided to you. You and each resident in your
household should review these guidelines periodically. The plan has been developed to
assist you in the unlikely event of fire, smoke or other emergency situations that may
require you to evacuate the building. It is also a good starting point as you pre-plan for
effective emergency action for your home. Because emergencies and disasters are
unpredictable by nature, it is not possible for this or any plan to cover every potential
situation that may arise; anticipating and developing a comprehensive emergency plan is
your responsibility.
Every emergency situation requires different responses, but there are certain
actions that should be taken in all situations. These are:
Always remain calm
Manage the situation; do not let the situation manage you! Panic is contagious so lead by
example. Remain calm and in control. Always exercise good judgment and do not put
yourself at risk.
Notify authorities
Be sure to contact all appropriate agencies (police, fire, rescue, poison control, utility
companies, etc.) immediately. Delaying this phone call will increase response time. If in
doubt, call 911. It is better to be safe than sorry.
Evacuation plan
Identify an evacuation route. Review this route with all household members periodically.
Emergency phone list
Post an emergency contact list to include fire, police, hospital, doctors, etc. in a
conspicuous and easily accessible location.
Special Assistance
Please ensure the management office is made aware of any resident who may need
special attention in an emergency situation. A notification form is found on the following
page.

Disaster Plan
Emergency Supplies
Stocking up now on emergency suppli.es can add to your safety and comfort during and
after an emergency. Store enough supplies for at least 72 hours. Assemble a Disaster
Supply Kit with items you may need in an evacuation. Store these supplies in sturdy,
easy-to-carry containers such as backpacks, duffel bags, or covered trash containers.
Supplies may include:
Survival
• A stocked first aid kit
• A first aid book
• A three-day supply of water ( one gallon per person per day)
• A three-day supply of nonperishable food (packaged, canned, etc.)
• Blankets or sleeping bags
• Essential.medication and glasses
• Can opener (non-electric)
• A flashlight with extra batteries
• Fire extinguisher
• Battery operated radio to receive updated emergency information and extra
batteries
• Sanitation supplies
• Money
• Fill tub with water at earliest warning of disaster to be used as a water supply and
to assist with flushing toilets
Safety. and Comfort
• One change of clothing and footwear per person
• Heavy gloves for clearing debris
Tools and Supplies
• Ax, shovel, broom
• Crescent wrench for turning off gas
• Screwdriver, pliers, hammer
• Coil of ½" rope
• 50" extension cord, normally orange in color. These cords are usually twice as
strong as your average rope and can be used as one.
• Plastic tape and sheeting


Steps to Safety
• Post all emergency numbers in a visible location.
• Contact your local emergency management or civil defense office and American
Red Cross chapter. Be prepared to take notes.
• Learn about your community's warning signals.
• Ask about animal care after a disaster. Animals may not be allowed inside
emergency shelters due to health regulations.
• Meet with family members and discuss a meeting place outside your
neighborhood in the event that you are unable to reach or return to your home.
• Find out how to help elderly or disabled persons, if needed.




Have a Plan
• Meet with your household members and discuss why you need to prepare for a
disaster. Plan to share responsibilities and work together as a team. Pick two
places to meet:
1. At the evacuation site designated for your unit in case of a sudden
emergency.
2. Outside your neighborhood, in case you can't return or get to your
home.
• Discuss what to do in an evacuation.
• Know your exits and escape routes. It will keep you from panicking if and when an evacuation is required. You should be able to find your way out of your home in the dark.
• Develop an individual evacuation route for each household member. Review and
practice evacuation often.
• If for any reason you should be displaced from your home on a temporary basis,
you might want to plan to stay with friends or relatives. Be sure they are
adequately prepared with enough supplies.
• Red Cross emergency shelters will be available in assigned county schools.
When such shelters are opened, they will be announced on radio or television. If
you plan to go to a shelter, be sure to leave as soon as the shelter's opening is
announced and bring along bedding, food for 24 hours, medication, flashlight and
a battery operated radio. Remember that a shelter is intended to save your life.
Some comforts may have to be sacrificed.
• Practice and Maintain your Plan
✓ Quiz household members every six months so they remember what to do
m an emergency.
✓ Conduct fire and emergency evacuation drills quarterly.
✓ Replaced stored water every three months and stored food every six
months.
✓ Test and recharge your fire extinguisher(s) according to manufacturer's
instructions.
✓ Test your smoke detectors:


Precautionary Measures
At Stratford Condominium, we care about our residents' well being. We would like you
to be aware of some important guidelines and precautionary tips for protecting your
personal property and yourself. We recommend that you practice the following
guidelines.
Precautionary Measures outside your Home
1. Lock your doors while you're gone. That means dead bolds, too!
2. Leave a radio playing softly when you're not at home.
3. Close and lock your windows when you're gone. Don't forget the sliding
glass doors, it applicable.
4. Purchase a lamp timer at a hardware store and set the timer when you are not
home in the evening or what you are on vacation.
5. Try not to walk outside alone at night.
6. Do not hide your front door key under the doormat or above your door. This
is usually the first place a burglar will look.
7. If you have an entry code, do not give your code to guests or strangers.
8. Arrange for your newspaper delivery to be stopped when you are on vacation.
Precautionary Measures Inside your Home
1. Lock your doors and windows, even when you are home.
2. If you have a deadbolt or night latch, use them even when you are home.
3. Never answer the door unless you know who is on the other side of the door
by looking through the peephole or a window. If you don't know the person,
talk to them without opening the door and don't open the door unless you are
satisfied with their identity. Do not open your door for solicitors.
4. If you hear someone at your door and the peephole has been covered, do not
open the door. Immediately call the police.
5. Be careful to whom you lend or give your keys.
6. If you are worried because you have lost a key, have a locksmith re-key your
lock. If you re-key your lock, please make sure management gets a copy of
the new key.
7. Keep the telephone numbers for the police and emergency medical services
handy.
8. Check your smoke detector periodically for dead batteries.
9. Report to management (in writing, dated and signed) any malfunction of
safety devices within the building such as burned out stairwell lights, parking lot lights, inoperable doors, etc.
10. Close your curtains or blinds at night.
11. Let the manager and your friends know when you are going to be gone for an
extended period of time. Ask your neighbors to keep an eye on your unit.
Management cannot assume any responsibility.
12. Mark or engrave valuable personal possessions for identification


Precautionary Measures Using Your Car
1. Lock your car doors when you are driving. Lock the doors and roll up the
windows when you leave the car parked.
2. Do not leave visible items in the car, such as purses, briefcases, audiotapes,
packages, money, etc.
3 . Do not leave your keys in the car.
4. No matter where you are, always carry your key ring in your hand when you
walk to the car. Don't ever stand by the car fumbling for keys.
5. Look in the back seat before you get in the car.
6. Do not stop alone at night at an automatic teller machine or a gas station.
Precautionary Personal Awareness
There is no such thing as a failsafe system. Precautions such as alarm systems,
courtesy guards, patrol cars and electronic gates are not guarantees against crime.
All systems are subject to personnel absenteeism, human error, mechanical
malfunctions and tampering. Ultimately, we are all responsible for our own safety
and well-being. Stratford Condominium does not in any way state or imply that we
offer any security or that the condominium community was or will be free of crime.
You should always proceed as if systems did not exist for your well being. The best
measures you can take are the ones you can perform yourself as a matter of
common sense. At Stratford Condominium, we care about residents' well being
and hope you will diligently practice the above guidelines.


Suggestions For Preventing Crime
• Do not leave extra keys under doormats, over doors.or some other likely places.
Every family member should have his or her own key.
• Remember - the best lock in the world is not good if you carelessly open your
door without knowing. Use your peephole - be wary of salespeople, solicitors,
utility employees, etc. They should have proper identifications.
• When leaving for an evening, leave at least one light burning in your unit.
• Going on vacation?
o Cancel deliveries, newspapers, etc.
o Put a light ( or lights) on a timer for automatic turn on at night.
o Check all doors and windows to make sure they are locked.
o Have a neighbor check you home occasionally.
o Do not tell people that you will be gone. You never know who will tell.
• Store valuables. Deposit cash you do not need. Store fur during the "off' season.
Consider keeping jewelry, coin collections, etc. in a safety deposit box.
• Keep serial numbers of cameras, watches, televisions, etc. Take photographs of
furniture, paintings, etc. Mark possessions with your driver's license number (or
other easily traceable identification number). This is useful to police in tracing
items as well as helpful in filing insurance claims.
• Start a "buddy system" with your neighbors in order to watch each other's homes.
Watch for unexpected strangers in the area. Report any suspicious actions,
sounds, and strangers to police.
·• Never carry large sums of cash.
• Do not resist an armed robber. Hand over your wallet or purse quickly and
quietly.
• Loud screams or flight may protect you from a strong, armed robber.
• Stay off dark streets. Walk with a companion when possible. Stay away from
dark alleys, bushes, etc.
• Know where your children are, what they are doing, and with whom.
• Call the police if you see or hear a crime. Do not investigate yourself.
• Lock your car when you leave it. Roll up windows. Take keys with you even if
you are stopping for only a moment.
• Use your trunk to store valuables such as cameras, binoculars, clothes, etc. Also,
keep in mind that items like car phones and radar detectors are extremely
attractive to thieves.
• Keep your registration with you. A thief can use your registration to show "legal"
possession of your car.
• Beware of hitchhikers. You can't tell a person's character by appearances.
• Report suspicious actions to the police - someone peering into every car on the
street, removing gasoline or license plates, etc.
• Be alert at all times for signs of criminal activity.


Suspicious Activity Reporting Guidelines
Why call the police?
Successful efforts to combat crime require the cooperative involvement of police
and citizens. The police cannot be everywhere. For this reason, success against crime is
dependent on citizen cooperation and involvement. Many crimes would not be
committed if more citizens were alert to suspicious activity and notify the police.
When should you call?
Whenever you observe a suspicious event, even though you may not be the only
person observing them, call the police. Never assume that another person will do what
you should do. The Police Department would rather receive numerous calls on the same
event than none at all.
Often citizens fail to call because they are uncertain that what they see or hear is
suspicious. If you are in doubt, call the police immediately. Do not wait to talk it over
with friends or neighbors. Valuable police response time is lost that way.
Do not be concerned about "bothering" your Police Department because you
won't be. Don't dwell on any possible embarrassment you might feel if your call should
prove to be unfounded. Think instead of what could have happened had you not called.
You, your loved ones, friends or neighbors could have become the victims of a criminal
act.
How do you call the police?
Use the police, fire, and rescue emergency number, 911, for crimes actually in
progress and events that are life threatening or immediately damaging to property. Call
the non-emergency number to report crimes which have already occurred and when the
perpetrator is no longer in the area or to advise police of any suspicious activity.
You will be asked for your name, address, and phone number. This information
is requested in case additional contact with you is necessary. You do not have to provide
this information if you do not want to. Any information provided to the Police
Department is kept confidential. If you do not want personal contact with the responding
officer, say so.
Know the emergency number for police, fire, and rescue. Simply dial 911 ( coins
are not required to dial 911 from public pay phones).
What the police need to know
The information police officers need most is:
• What happened
• When it happened
• Where it happened
• If anyone is hurt
• Vehicle descriptions, including color, make and model
• License numbers of vehicle
• Direction of travel
• Description(s) of suspect(s)
• If there were any weapons involved


What is suspicious?
Here are some examples of what to look for. They may be helpful in determining
when you should call for assistance.
• A stranger entering your neighbor's home while your neighbor is away. Remember,
burglaries often occur at times when they should be most obvious - in broad daylight,
in full view of observers and with no effort at subterfuge.
• Someone carrying property such as television sets, radios, stereos, etc. at an unusually
late hour or in an unusual place, especially if it does not appear that the property is
newly purchased.
• The sound of shattering glass could signal a possible burglary, vandalism, or larceny
m progress.
• Anyone peering into vehicles or someone removing tags, gasoline, or parts from a
car. Someone attempting to enter a car using a coat hanger or other devices. Never
assume that it is the owner who has locked his or her keys in the car. Be suspicious
of anyone tampering with the hood or trunk of a car.
• An improperly parked car, an abandoned vehicle, or someone leaving one car and
driving away in another. These may be signs of a stolen vehicle.
• Anyone being forced into a vehicle could be the victim of a possible abduction.
• Persons loitering around schools, parks, and isolated areas, or in the neighborhood.
Loiterers could be possible sex offenders or burglars.
• Business transactions conducted from a vehicle, especially around schools,
playgrounds, or parks and often on a regular basis at unusual times. This could
indicate drug sales or a fencing operation.
• Offers of goods or repairs at unusually low prices could indicate stolen property or
some type of fraud.
• All fights, screams, and loud noises (such as explosions) should be reported, as
possible crimes or life-threatening events could be taking place.
• Door-to-door solicitors without properly issued licenses.


Fire or Other Emergency Evacuation Guidelines
These guidelines have been developed by management to assist residents in the
evacuation of their condominium and building in the unlikely event of fire, smoke, or
other emergency situations.
Do Not Panic!
• Know your exits and escape routes. It will keep you from panic if and when a fire
should occur. You should be able to find your way out of your unit in the dark.
• Leave the building immediately. Do not use the elevator and remember to take
your keys.
• Yell fire (or specific emergency), alert everyone in your unit, and knock on
neighboring doors while evacuating.
• If there is a fire, remember that heat and smoke rises. Stay low while exiting your
home.
• Blow out candles and turn off all appliances (stove, iron, etc.)
• Call 911 and give the exact location of the fire, including community n􀊓e,
address, unit number, and floor.
• Proceed to the evacuation location designated for your building as shown on the
evacuation map included in this plan. If you cannot reach the evacuation site for
any reason, go to any safe area at least 50 feet away from the building and await
instructions from the fire department and/or management staff.
• . Have a designated meeting area, within the evacuation location of your building,
for all family members to gather.
ALWAYS evacuate the building when the alarm goes off or if you smell smoke, even
if you do not see the evidence of fire.
If you are alerted to a fire by smoke from the hallway, or by an alarm, and do not know
the origin of the fire, check the doorknob and the entire door to see if it is hot. Then
proceed to the closest stairwell.
If the doorknob is cool
• Open the door slowly and look into the hallway.
• If the hallway is clear, leave the unit and close the door behind you.


• Do not lock your unit door. It may be necessary for the fire department to enter your
unit.
• If there is smoke, crawl to the nearest exit staying close to the floor and close to the
wall. Do this even if the smoke is tolerable while standing.
• Proceed to the front of the exterior of the building and wait for further instructions
from the authorities. Keep the lobby and front entrance clear for firefighters.
• lf y01.i cannot get to the front door and are on the second floor, stay in the unit.
Remain calm. If the telephone works, call for help (911). Hang a sheet out of the
window to signal fire fighters help is needed. Do not try to use the sheet to climb
down the building. Do not jump from windows or balconies.
If the doorknob and/or the door is hot
• . Stay in the unit, remain calm, and call 911 giving the exact location o f the fire,
including community name, address, apartment number, and floor.
• Hang a sheet out of the window signaling that fire fighters help is needed. Do not try
to use the sheet to try to climb down the building. Do not jump from windows or
balconies.
• Stuff wet towels in cracks around the door to keep smoke out.
• Use a bucket of cold water to splash on the door or walls if they become hot.
• A wet towel tied around your mouth and nose will help filter smoke.
• If there are drapes or other combustible items near the hot areas, move them.
NEVER, NEVER, NEVER go back into the unit until the fire department or
management staff indicates that it is ok to do so.
For a Localized Fire
• Call the local fire department ( dial 911) immediately.
• Activate building fire alarm.
• Evacuate building, if necessary.
General Fire Alarm Information for Stratford Condominium
• In the High Rise, the fire alarm only sounds on the floor or floors Where it is
activated and the floors immediately above and below, and the elevators and
stairwells. This is generally preceded by a prerecorded message stating that there
14
is a fire emergency in the building. The Mid-rise units, the alarm will sound in
the whole building.
• If the alarm comes from the lobby, the whole building will sound the alarm.
• Elevators will return to the lobby and will not be accessible by residents.
Precautionary Measures Against Fire
Every year 5,500 Americans die in fires and more than 30,000 are injured. Most
fire deaths occur in the home, and many can be prevented. Fire safety practices save
lives.
To protect yourself, it is important to understand the basic characteristics of fire.
A fire spreads quickly. There is not time to grab valuables or make a phone call. In just
two minutes, a fire can become life threatening. In five minutes, a house can be engulfed
in flames.
A fire's heat and smoke are even more dangerous than the flames. Inhaling the
super-hot air can sear your lungs. Fire produces poisonous gases that make you
disoriented and drowsy. Instead of being awakened by a fire, you may fall into a deeper
sleep.
Prevent fires by:
• Regularly test smoke detectors to ensure they are working.
• Make sure you do not let flammable items such as newspapers stack up inside
your home.
• Store flammable materials outside in special containers.
• Keep electrical appliances and wiring in good repair and use electrical appliances
only as instructed.
• Smokers can prevent fires. Always check furniture/carpet for ash and lit
cigarettes before going to sleep or leaving your home.
• Never smoke in bed. Only use fireproof ashtrays.
• When cooking, do not wear bulky sleeves.
• Keep the filter on your hood fan clean of grease by washing often.
• Know where your circuit breaker box is located. If, at anytime, an appliance
sparks· or shorts out, you can flip the switch at the circuit breaker box to turn off
the power to that area, without danger to yourself.
• Don't overload outlets or extension cords. Protect cords from injury. Don't place
furniture or appliances on extension cords.
• Christmas tree lights should be new or in excellent condition. For live trees, the
tree water reservoir should always be filled. Never leave lights on when away or
asleep. Keep candles away from trees.
• Keep furniture, drapes, and combustibles away from all heaters.


Flood Emergency Guidelines
Flood Watch
A flood watch means flooding is possible in your area. If the National Weather Service
issues a flash flood watch for your area:
• Stay tuned to local radio and. TV stations for vital information.
• • Plan and prepare your evacuation route.
• Keep alert for signs of flash flooding, such as intense rainfall or rising waters.
If you suspect flooding has started, go to safety immediately.
Flood Warning
A flood warning means flooding is occurring or will occur soon. If the National Weather
Service issues a flood warning for your area:
• Listen to local radio and TV stations for vital information.
• Move furniture and valuables to higher ground.
• Tum off your utilities if your home is likely to be flooded.
• Fill your car's gas tank with gasoline.
• Evacuate if you are told to do so.
Flash Flood Warning
A flash flood warning means you may only have seconds to escape. A flash flood can
happen so rapidly that you may not get a warning. If the National Weather Service issues
a flash flood warning for your area or if you suspect a flash flood is happening:
• Leave low-lying areas immediately. Seek high ground. Wait for emergency
assistance.
• Do not use water-covered roadways. Rushing water can be.dangerous.
• Stay away from storm drains and irrigation ditches. Stay clear of down power
lines.
• If your car stalls in rapidly rising water, abandon it immediately and climb to
higher ground.
The Greatest Dangers
Rushing water from floods is extremely dangerous. Remember:
• Police barricades are there for your protection. Do not drive around them.
• Floodwaters covering roads or bridges have more force and power than you
might think.
• Walking or driving through floodwaters is the most dangerous thing you can
do.
If your designated meeting place is a low lying area with the potential to flood, be sure
you have a back up meeting location for your family to meet.


Gas Emergency Guidelines
If you smell gas, call the gas company and management office immediately. Take the
precautions below until a professional arrives.
• A void making any sparks or turning on any lights. Do not light matches or
lighters.
• Do not tum on your gas stove.
• Open all windows in your home.
• Wait outside until a professional arrives.
If the gas smell is overwhelming, evacuate your home immediately. Knock on
neighbor's doors as you exit and instruct them to evacuate.
Call 911 and the management office from a location away from the building.


Hurricane Emergency Guidelines
Because a hurricane's path is often tracked for days, there is usually time for
preparation and preventive measures to be taken. At a minimum, you should have at
least one day's notice. Hurricane watches are upgraded to warnings when the hurricane
is expected to strike an area within 24 hours.
There are a number of preventive measures you can take during this time to
prevent injury and property damage.
• Remove all items from balconies/patios and place them indoors
• Have all emergency supplies ready. These items will be needed if you loose
electricity and water.
During a Hurricane
Remain indoors, on the ground floor if possible, and proceed to an interior
hallway, staying away from windows.
If outdoors, seek shelter in a ditch, culvert, or excavation area and lie flat.
Do not be fooled by the eye of the hurricane. If it passed directly overhead, there
will be a lull in the wind lasting for several minutes or up to half and hour or more.
After a Hurricane
If your building becomes uninhabitable, go immediately to your designated
meeting area.
Be extremely careful in moving around on the property. Watch for live electrical
wires, shattered glass, splintered wood, etc.
Be prepared for possible flooding.


Tornado Emergency Guidelines
All residents should know the difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning,
as they require different action on the part of the resident.
Tornado Watch
A tornado watch means that the conditions are right for a tornado to form. The
conditions include, but are not limited to, hot "sticky" days, southerly winds, and
threatening skies with clouds that appear greenish-black. Most tornadoes occur between
3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.
You should stay close to home and not be outdoors if a watch is present. Be sure
your emergency supplies are ready and handy.
Remove all items from your balcony/patio, if possible.
Tornado Warning
A tornado warning is issued when a tornado has been sighted. A tornado sound
resembles a deep roar, like a long, fast train 􀊕r several large airplanes.
When a warning is issued:
• Do not try and outrun a tornado with car or by foot.
• Do not stand in windows or doorways to view the tornado.
•Go to the smallest room, with interior walls (no windows) in the unit (bathroom,
closet) and take a pillow and a blanket ( or mattress, if possible) to cover yourself
and protect from possible debris.
• If possible, get into the bathtub and pull the pillow and blanket over you .
• If children are present, the adult should cover the child .
• It is suggested that some of the windows on the northeast side of the building
should be left open so the air pressure in the building will be able to equal the air
pressure in the tornado.
• If you are in transit in the building, go into the stairwell.






It is important to react to the warming immediately as the average speed of a tornado is
25-40 miles per hour; however, the actual variance of the speed of a tornado is 5-13 9
miles per hour. This does not allow much time to prepare yourself for a possible tornado.
Following a tornado, go immediately to your designated evacuation location so that
everyone can be accounted for.


Electrical Storm
• Do not use phones other than cordless or wireless.
• Do not take baths or showers until the storm subsides.
• Electrical components i.e. computers, televisions, stereos, etc. should be on surge
protectors to safeguard against brownouts or electrical surges.
• Keep an alternate lighting source readily available.
• If your home's heat is powered by electricity, by sure that you have the means to
stay warm (i.e. extra clothes and blankets).
• Bring all household members inside.


Power Outage
• Look at other nearby homes to make sure the problem is widespread. If yours is
the only home without power, the problem maybe a blown fuse or tripped circuit
breaker. When calling to report lights out, also report any unusual occurrences
that you saw you that you heard. For example: a tree on a line, a car hit a pole, or
a loud noise. Be sure when making the report to give your name, address, and
general area of the outage.
• Conserve your water supply. In the high rise, the booster pump is not run on the
emergency generator and eventually the water pressure will drop (from the top
floor. The mid-rise units do not have a generator and the lights in the hallways
operate on battery power. If the lights are out for an extended amount of time, the
battery powered lights will eventually be out and the hallways will be dark. You
should plan to keep a flashlight in your unit and car in case the power is out when
you get home.
• Have emergency supplies on hand.
• Disconnect or turn off major appliances that could come on suddenly when power
is restored. This will help prevent blowing a fuse or tripping a circuit breaker.
• Always leave a light or radio on to signal you when the power is restored.
• Food in a freezer will remain frozen from 24 to 48 hours depending on how full
the freezer is. A void opening the freezer door to check food as this quickly
reduces the freezer's temperature and foods will thaw more quickly.
• Stay away from downed power lines. Treat all downed wires as "live" and
dangerous. Call the local utility or local emergency officials immediately if you
see wires or poles lying on the ground.


Elevator Emergency
Elevators are one of the safest modes of transportation. However, they do have
malfunctions due to their sophisticated automatic controls
What to do in an emergency:
• Open the telephone panel inside the elevator.
• Push the button to connect to a 24 hour emergency service operator. They
have 24-hour access to the building.

Winter and Cold Weather Suggestions
• Monitor weather reports frequently for adverse weather such as freezing
conditions, low temperatures, heavy snowfall, etc.
• If extreme cold weather is expected, open cabinets in your unit that contain water
pipes so that the warm air may circulate around them to help reduce the chance of
pipes freezing.
• Keep the heat in your unit on at all times, even if you are leaving town.
• Be aware that ice forms on wooden steps and porches before it shows up on
sidewalks. Keep in mind that frost can also cause slippery surfaces.
• If you are unsteady on your feet, avoid walking in bad weather.
• Be careful when walking up or down stairs. Place the whole foot on each step
and use the handrail.
• If you must walk on icy, wet, or snowy sidewalks, wear shoes that have a good
tread.
• Remember that icy surfaces at 10 degrees aren't as slippery as they are at 3 2
degrees. Ice, at 3 2 degrees, will be topped with a thin surface of water making it
more hazardous.
• Dress for cold weather by using layers of clothing, since layers will retain body
heat longer.
• Pay close attention to wind and chill factors during weather reports since these
factors cause increases in severity of outside temperatures.
• When going outdoors, make sure body parts that lose heat faster, such as the face,
ears, and hands, are adequately protected from the weather.
• Disconnect water hoses from outside faucets.


Winter Driving
If you must travel, consider taking public transportation. If you travel by car,
travel during the day. Do not travel alone and keep others informed of your schedule.
Stay on main roads and avoid back-road shortcuts.
Safe drivers are not born. Safe driving is a skill that is learned through education
and practice. As a safe driver, you must be prepared for situations or conditions that are
encountered while driving. This includes potential problems related to winter driving.
Preparation
The best defense against mechanical problems that occur during cold w􀊖ather is to
prepare your vehicle. Closely examine the following parts of the vehicle yourself or have
a qualified mechanic check them. Remember that severe weather is no time to have
problems with vehicle systems.
• Anti.freeze: Check to ensure your car has sufficient antifreeze.
• Battery: Check the battery terminals to be sure they are clean and free from
corrosion. Test the battery to determine its strength and recharge or replace it if
necessary. Check the other components of the electrical systems such as the
voltage regulator and alternator to ensure they are working properly.
• Ignition System: One of the best ways to check the ignition system is to have a
mechanic examine all of the components during a tune-up. The main parts of the
system that require a thorough check are the ignition wires and the distributor cap.
Faulty wires or a cracked cap can result in an engine coming to an abrupt halt
with little warning.
• Heating and Cooling System: Pay special attention to the radiator and hoses by
checking for leaks or excessive wear. Have them repaired if there is doubt about
whether they will stand up to cold weather. Next, refer to the manufacturer's
instructions for recommended time limits between antifreeze changes. Change
the antifreeze, if necessary, and check the level to be sure the system is full. In
addition, test the vehicle heater and defroster for proper operation.
• Exhaust System: Exhaust systems must be checked completely and any leaks in
the system repaired immediately. Exhaust fumes and gases that find their way
into the passenger compartment can create serious problems.
• Windshield Wiper/Washers: Always keeps the washer reservoir full of antifreeze
washer solution during the winter months and keep extra solution readily
available. Closely examine wiper blades and replace them if needed. Good
visibility is essential for safe vehicle operation during the winter.
• Tires: Check the tread depth on snow tires and keep them properly inflated. Air
pressure should be checked at least every two weeks. As a rule, tire pressure will
drop 1 psi for every drop in temperature of 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Use snow
tires.
• Chains: If you use chains, inspect them and make sure they are serviceable.
Check the condition of the cross-links and replace those that are almost worn
through. Remember to use proper safety precautions when installing or removing
chains from vehicles.


Emergency Supplies
All vehicles used for winter driving should be properly equipped with items that may be
needed during adverse weather. The following articles should be considered when
preparing a vehicle for winter driving:
• Flashlight
• Ice Scraper
• Brush and small broom
• Extra fuses
• Rag (to clean lights and windshields if you run out of washer fluid)
• Spare washer fluid
• Pair of work gloves
• Small shovel
• Small bag of salt, sand, kitty litter, etc.
• Battery booster or jumper cables
• Blanket
• Heavy winter clothing
• Highway reflector triangle, flares, etc.
• Tire chains with repair links
• Battery powered radio and extra batteries
• Water
• Snack food
• Tow Chain or rope
• A fluorescent distress flag
• Road maps
• Emergency flares
Driving Techniques for ice/snow
• Determine if your trip is necessary and whether it can be postponed until driving
conditions improve. If you must drive, keep the following tips in mind:
• Glare: Sun glaring off of snow and ice presents a real danger to drivers. Use
your visor and sun or glare-reducing glasses while driving.
• Safe Following Distance: Assess the traction provided by your vehicle when
roads are slippery and follow at a safe distance. Remember to be alert and
properly judge your distance since conditions can change rapidly.
• Braking: When possible, use engine-breaking power by down shifting to a
lower gear. When you must brake, engage and release them in a pumping motion.
• Skids: Don't panic. Ease up on the accelerator and steer in the direction of the
skid (for example, if the vehicle is skidding toward the right, turn the steering
wheel to the right). When you regain steering control, resume braking by
pumping the brakes lightly.
• Traction: Start out slowly if you are on a slippery surface. If the wheels begin
spinning, ease up on the accelerator until traction returns. Before going uphill,
increase speed slightly to build up momentum for climbing. When reaching the
26
crest of the hill, reduce speed, shift into a lower gear and go downhill slowly.
A void using your brakes on slippery hills, but if you must reduce speed, tap and
release the brakes in a pumping action.
• Slippery Surfaces: A winter sun can warm ice enough to make it twice as
slippery. Remember that bridge floors and elevated roadways freeze before other
surfaces. Shaded areas, like underpasses, often contain ice patches. If you hit an
icy spot, ease up on the accelerator, steer steady, and roll through the icy area.
• Stuck in a Rut: The action taken depends on how badly you are stuck. A void
spinning your wheels since this will aggravate the problem. If the snow is deep,
shovel it from in front and back of the wheels (both front and back wheels).
Shovel as much snow from under the vehicle as possible without getting
underneath. Then spread salt or kitty litter in front and behind the driving wheels.
Don't let anyone stand directly behind or in front of the vehicle. If you are using
traction devices under the wheels, or wheels dig into dirt or gravel, people around
the vehicle may be injured. Always keep the front wheels pointed straight ahead
until the vehicle is moving. The resistance of front wheels is decreased when they
are not trying to move sideways. If the vehicle still doesn't move, stop and let the
tires cool. Tires heated from spinning will dig a deeper rut. If nothing else
works, try to rock the vehicle out of the rut by alternately shifting from reverse to
second gear (vehicles with manual transmission) or to drive (vehicles with
automatic transmission). In vehicles with automatic transmissions, check the
owner's manual to make sure this procedure can be done safely with that
particular vehicle.
If a Blizzard Traps You in Your Car
• Pull off the highway. Set your hazard lights to "flashing" and hang a distress flag
from the radio antenna or window.
• Remain in your vehicle where rescuers are most likely to find you. Do not set
out on foot unless you can take shelter. Be careful, distances are distorted by
blowing snow. A building may seem close, but may be too far to walk to in deep
snow.
• Run the engine and heater about ten minutes each hour to keep warm. When the
engine is running, open a window slightly for ventilation. This will protect you
from possible carbon monoxide poisoning. Periodically clear away snow from
the exhaust pipe.
• Exercise to maintain body heat, but avoid overexertion. In extreme cold, use
road maps, seat covers, and floor mats for insulation. Huddle with passengers
and use your coat for a blanket.
• Take turns sleeping. One person should be awake at all times to look out for
rescue crews.
• Be careful not to use up battery power. Balance electrical energy needs - the use
of lights, heat and radio - with supply.
• At night, tum on the inside dome light so work crews can see you.
• If stranded in a remote rural or wilderness area, spread a large cloth over the
snow to attract attention of rescue personnel who may be surveying the area by
airplane. Once the blizzard passes, you may need to leave the car and proceed on
foot.
