General Information for Residents


“Dear Residents:
Every unit in this building has an analog intercom, connecting the phone set in the outer front
lobby, to each unit's designated telephone line. Should you want to change the designated
telephone line, please contact someone from the Stratford Team.
How It Works -
When arriving visitor or delivery person wishes access to the building, they locate the appropriate
code for the person or unit number by scrolling with “A” and “Z” and dial the presented code
using the keypad.
The unit resident's phone will ring. Their caller ID will display the 10- digit 703-638-xxxx
number assigned to the intercom device.
To unlock the inner front door, the unit resident presses the number 5 button on their phone’s
keypad. This allows the front door to be opened. The incoming person can now access the main
lobby area and elevators to the upper floors. If you are a Court Resident
What This Means to You -
When you access the phone punch-down panel located in each hallway, you will notice some "odd
looking" wired connections. These odd-looking cross connections are meant to convert the
incoming signals to make a hard-wired “cross-connect” in order to provide analog signal to the
unit’s phone to continue to use the front door analog intercom system.
Unfortunately, the engineers who first installed the service to this building failed to document this
needed feature.
Do You Have Questions?
If you have questions about how this works, or how it is supposed to work, please call Richard
Goodwin, Assistant Manager at (703) 638-6611 or Sabrina Lovera, Administrative Assistant at
(703) 638- 6611. Both are located at Stratford Court. If you would like to contact the Property
Manager, Sabiha Noorzai, you may call her at (703) 638- 6755. Her office is located in the main
lobby of Stratford House.”


Instructions for Lighting Pilot Light on Fireplace
If the pilot light has been off for an extended period of time, the air must be
eliminated from the line before the pilot light can be lit. Here's what to do:
1. On pilot light, turn knob to PILOT setting.
2. Hold the pilot button IN to release air in the line. You will hear air being released
(it's only air, not gas). Push the Igniter button intermittently (every 10
seconds) while doing this. It will take approx. 1-3 minutes or even a little
longer to release all the air.
3. Once the pilot light is lit continue to hold the pilot light in for another minute
to make sure that it stays lit and then turn the pilot knob clockwise to ON.
• Pilot Light Button - Located under the burner, on
• the silver box, on the right side.
• Igniter Button - Round button on right front side of fireplace. The
knob is on the bottom left side of this area.
• Instructions for this procedure are located on the fireplace grate, under
the gravel.

• Empty all trash.
• Remove any perishable food from the refrigerator and pantry.
• Stop your newspapers, hold or forward your mail.
• Lock your windows and doors (don’t forget the sliders) and consider closing your shades or drapes.
• Be sure the Stratford office has a valid copy of your front door key to use in an emergency.
• Update your contact information (where you can be reached in an emergency) with the Stratford office
or in BuildingLink. If possible, leave a local contact for emergencies.
• Be sure all your cars have been registered with Stratford and have parking decals or a visitor pass.
• Remove or secure all items on your balcony.
• Leave your heat on and set a minimum of 60 degrees.
• If you have a humidifier as part of you HVAC system, ensure your condensation lines are clear (done
during a HVAC system checkup by your HVAC service provider)
• Put fresh batters in your smoke detectors and water alarms.
• Turn off the icemaker in your refrigerator, and make sure appliances are off (and remove dirty dishes
from the dishwasher and sink).
• Turn off water in your unit, open several faucets around your home to drain the water from the pipes.
• If you are leaving for more than a month, turn off the circuit breaker from the water heater.
• If you have left a car, be sure your keys are where they can be found if the car needs to be moved in an
emergency or make arrangements with a neighbor.
• A reminder that you may enter a “Front Desk Instruction” in BuildingLInk with information about how
to contact you, emergency contacts, and information about how you will be out of town. This is very
helpful to all staff if residents utilize this feature on a regular basis. If you need assistance, please let us
know as well as send written instructions for the staff via email.
