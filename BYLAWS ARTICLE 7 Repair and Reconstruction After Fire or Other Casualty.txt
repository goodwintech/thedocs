Repair and Reconstruction After Fire or Other Casualty
Section 7.1. When Repair and Reconstruction are Required. Except as otherwise provided in Section 7.4, if all or any part of any building is damaged or destroyed as a result of fire or other casualty, the Board of Directors shall arrange for and supervise the prompt repair and restoration thereof (including without limitation any damaged units, and the floor coverings, fixtures and appliances initially installed therein by the Declarant, and replacements thereof installed by the unit owners up to the value of those initially installed by the Declarant, but not including any furniture, furnishings, fixtures, equipment or other personal property supplied or installed by the unit owners in the units unless covered by insurance obtained by the Unit Owners Association). Notwithstanding the foregoing, each unit owner shall have the right to supervise the redecorating of the unit.
Section 7.2. Procedure for Reconstruction and Repair.
1.               Cost Estimates. Immediately after a fire or other casualty causing damage to any portion of the building, the Board of Directors shall obtain reliable and detailed estimates of the cost of repairing and restoring such portion (including without limitation any damaged units and any floor coverings and fixtures and appliances initially installed by the Declarant, and the replacements thereof installed by the unit owners up to the value of those initially installed by the Declarant, but not including any other furniture, furnishings, fixtures or equipment installed by the unit owner in the unit unless covered by insurance obtained by the Unit Owners Association) to a condition as good as that existing before such casualty. Such costs may also include professional fees and premiums for such bonds as the insurance trustee determines to be necessary.
2.               Assessments. If the proceeds of insurance are not sufficient to defray such estimated costs of reconstruction and repair, or if upon completion of reconstruction and repair the funds for the payment of the costs are insufficient, the amount necessary to complete such reconstruction and repair may be obtained from the appropriate reserve for replacement funds and/or shalt be deemed a common expense and a special assessment for such amount shall be levied.
3.                Plans and Specifications. Any such reconstruction or repair shall be substantially in accordance with the original construction of the Property, subject to any modifications required by changes in applicable governmental regulations, and using contemporary building materials and technology to the extent feasible; provided, however, that other action may be taken if approved by at least fifty-one percent of the Mortgagees.
Section 7.3. Disbursements of Construction Funds.
1.               Construction Fund and Disbursement. The proceeds of insurance collected on account of casualty, and the sums received by the insurance trustee from collections of assessments against unit owners on account of such casualty, shall constitute a construction fund which shall be disbursed in payment of the costs of reconstruction and repair in the following manner:
1.   If the estimated Cost of reconstruction and repair is less than ten percent of the total annual assessment for common expenses for that fiscal year, then the construction fund shall be disbursed in payment of such costs upon order of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that upon request of twenty percent of the Mortgagees, such fund shall be disbursed pursuant to paragraph (2).
2.             If the estimated cost of reconstruction and repair is ten percent of the total annual assessment for common expenses for that fiscal year or more, then the construction fund shall be disbursed in payment of such costs upon approval of an architect qualified to practice in Virginia and employed by the insurance trustee to supervise such work, payment to be made from time to time as the work progresses. The architect shall be required to furnish a certificate giving a brief description of the services and materials furnished by various contractors, subcontractors, material men, the architect and other persons who have rendered services or furnished materials in connection with the work stating that: (i) the sums requested by them in payment are justly due and owing and that such sums do not exceed the· value of the services and materials furnished; (ii) there is no other outstanding indebtedness known to such architect for the services and materials described; and (iii) the cost as estimated by such architect for the work remaining • to be done subsequent to the date of such certificate does not exceed the amount of the construction fund remaining after payment of the sum so requested.
(b)           Surplus. The first monies disbursed in payment of the cost of reconstruction and  repair shall be from insurance proceeds and, if there is a balance in the construction fund after the payment of all of the costs of the reconstruction and repair for which the fund is established, such balance shall be divided among all unit owners in proportion to their Common Element Interests and shall be distributed in accordance with the priority of interests at law or in equity in each unit.
(c)          Common Elements. When the damage is to both common elements and units, the insurance proceeds shall be applied first to the cost of repairing those portions of the common elements which enclose and service the units, then to the cost of repairing the other common elements and thereafter to the cost of repairing the units.
(d)              Certificate. The insurance trustee shall be entitled to rely upon a certificate executed by the President or Vice President, and the Secretary, certifying: (i) whether the damaged Property is required to be reconstructed and repaired; (ii) the name of the payee and the amount to be paid with respect to disbursement from any construction fund or whether surplus funds to be distributed are less than the assessments paid by the unit owners; and (iii) all other matters concerning the holding and disbursing of any construction fund. Any such certificate shall be delivered to the insurance trustee promptly after request.
Section 7.4. When Reconstruction, ls Not Required. Unless the Condominium is terminated, if the Board of Directors elects not to repair insubstantial damage to the common elements, the Board of Directors shall use the insurance proceeds to remove all remains of the damaged improvements and restore the site to an acceptable condition compatible with the remainder of the Condominium and distribute the balance of any insurance proceeds received on account of such damage to all unit owners in proportion to their respective Common Element Interests. If the Condominium is terminated pursuant to section 55-79.72:1 of the Condominium Act, the net assets of the Condominium together with the net proceeds of insurance policies, if any, shall be divided by the insurance trustee among all unit owners in proportion to their respective Common Element Interests, after first paying out of the share of each unit owner, to the extent sufficient therefor, the amount of any unpaid liens on the unit in the order of priority of such liens.
