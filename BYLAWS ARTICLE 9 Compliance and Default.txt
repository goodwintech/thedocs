ARTICLE 9
Compliance and Default
Section 9.1. Relief. Each unit owner shall be governed by, and shall comply with, all of the terms of the Condominium Act, condominium instruments and rules and regulations, as any of the same may be amended from time to time. In addition to the remedies provided in section 55-79.53 of the Condominium Act, a default by a unit owner shall entitle the Unit Owners Association, acting through its Board of Directors or through the managing agent, to the following relief.
(a)              Additional Liability. Each unit owner shall be liable to the Association or to any affected unit owner for the expense of all maintenance, repair or replacement rendered necessary by such unit owner's act, neglect or carelessness or the act, neglect or carelessness of any member of such unit owner’s household or such unit owner's guests, invitees, tenants. agents or employees, but only to the extent that such expense is not covered by the proceeds of insurance carried by the Board of Directors. Such liability shall include any increase in casualty insurance rates occasioned by use, misuse, occupancy or abandonment of any unit or its appurtenances. Nothing contained herein, however, shall be construed as modifying any waiver by any insurance company of its rights of subrogation. Any costs, including without limitation legal fees, incurred as a result of a failure to comply with the Condominium Act, the condominium instruments and the rules and regulations by any unit owner (or any member of such unit owners household or such unit owners guests, invitees, tenants, agents or employees) may be assessed against such unit owners unit.
(b)              Costs and Attorney's Fees. In any proceedings arising out of any alleged default by a unit owner, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover the costs of such proceeding and such reasonable attorney's fees as may be determined by the court.
(c)               No Waiver of Rights. The failure of the Unit Owners Association, the Board of Directors or of a unit owner to enforce any right, provision, covenant or condition which may be granted by the condominium instruments or the Condominium Act shall not constitute a waiver of the right of the Association, the Board or the unit owner to enforce such right, provision, covenant or condition in the future. All rights, remedies and privileges granted to the Association, the Board of Directors or any unit owner pursuant to any term, provision, covenant or condition of the condominium instruments or the Condominium Act shall be deemed to be cumulative and the exercise of any one or more thereof shall not be deemed to constitute an election of remedies, nor shall it preclude the party exercising the same from exercising such other privileges as may be granted to such party by the condominium instruments or the Condominium Act or at law or in equity.
(d)         Interest. In the event of a default by any unit owner in paying any sum assessed against the condominium unit other than for common expenses which continues for a period in excess of fifteen days, interest from the due date at a rate not to exceed the lower of the maximum permissible interest rate which may be charged by a Mortgagee under a Mortgage at such time or eighteen percent per annum may be imposed in the discretion of the Board of Directors on the principal amount unpaid from the date due until paid.
 (e)             Abating and Enjoining Violations by Unit Owners. The violation of any of the rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Directors, the breach of any provision of the condominium instruments or the Condominium Act shall give the Board of Directors the right, in addition to any other rights set forth in these Bylaws:  (i) to enter the unit in which, or as to which, such violation or breach exists and summarily to abate and remove, at the expense of the defaulting unit owner, any structure, thing or condition that may exist therein contrary to the intent and meaning of the provisions hereof, and the Board of Directors shall not thereby be deemed guilty in any manner of trespass; (ii) to use self-help to remove or cure any violation of the condominium instruments or the rules and regulations on the common elements (including without limitation the towing of vehicles) or in any unit; or (iii) to enjoin, abate or remedy by appropriate legal proceedings, either at law or in equity, the continuance of any such breach; provided, however, that before any construction may be altered or demolished (except in emergencies) judicial proceedings shall be instituted.
 (f)               Legal Proceedings. Failure to comply with any of the terms of the condominium instruments and the rules and regulations shall be grounds for relief, including without limitation, an action to recover any sums due for money damages, injunctive relief, foreclosure of the lien for payment of all assessments, any other relief provided for in these Bylaws or any combination thereof and any other relief afforded by a court of competent jurisdiction, all of which relief may be sought by the Association, the Board of Directors, the managing agent or, if appropriate, by any aggrieved unit owner and shall not constitute an election of remedies.
(g)              Charges. In accordance with section 55-79.80:2 of the Condominium Act, the Board of Directors and the Covenants Committee may levy reasonable charges against unit owners for violations of the Condominium Act, the condominium instruments or the rules and. regulations by the unit owner, the members of such unit owner's household, or such unit owner's guests, invitees, tenants, agents or employees. No charge may be levied for a single violation in an amount more than the lesser of (i) the maximum amount permitted by section 55-79.80:28 of the Condominium Act or (ii) one percent of such unit owner's annual assessment. Each day a violation continues, after notice is given to the unit owner, is a separate violation. If a unit owner requests in writing a hearing before the charge is imposed, the imposition of the charge shall be suspended until the hearing is held. Charges are special assessments and shall be collectible as such.
(h)      Other Remedies. In accordance with section 55-79.80:2 of the Condominium Act, the Board of Directors may suspend or revoke a unit owner's recreational or other privileges for a reasonable period not to exceed the duration of the default or violation if payment of the assessment on the unit is delinquent more than thirty days or for any other violation of the condominium instruments or the rules and regulations.
Section 9. 2. Lien for Assessments.
(a)              Lien. The total annual assessment of each unit owner for common expenses or any special assessment, or any other sum duly levied {including without limitation charges, interest, late charges, etc.), made pursuant to these Bylaws, is hereby declared to be a lien levied against the condominium unit of such unit owner as provided in section 55-79.84 of the Condominium Act, which lien shall, with respect to annual assessments, be effective on the first day of each fiscal year of the Condominium and, as to special assessments and other sums duly levied, on the first day of the next month which begins more than seven days after delivery to the unit owner of notice of such specia1 assessment or levy. The Board of Directors or the managing agent may file or record such other or further notice of any such lien, or such other or further" document, as may be required to confirm the establishment and priority of such lien.
(b)              Acceleration. In any case where an assessment against a unit owner is payable in installments, upon a default by such unit owner in the timely payment of any two consecutive Installments, the maturity of the remaining total of the unpaid installments of such assessments may be accelerated, at the option of the Board of Directors, and the entire balance of the annual assessment may be declared due and payable in full by the service of notice to such effect upon the defaulting unit owner and such unit owner's Mortgagee by the Board of Directors or the managing agent.
(c)               Enforcement. The lien for assessments may be enforced and foreclosed in any manner permitted by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, by power of sale (pursuant to section 55-79.841 of the Condominium Act or Section 9.3) or action in the name of the Board of Directors, or the managing agent, acting on behalf of the Unit Owners Association. During the pendency of such suit the unit owner shall be required to pay a reasonable rental for the unit for any period prior to sale pursuant to any judgment or order of any court having jurisdiction over such sale. The plaintiff in such proceeding shall have the right to the appointment of a receiver, if available under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
(d)              Remedies Cumulative. A suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid assessments may be maintained without foreclosing or waiving the lien securing the same, and a foreclosure may be maintained notwithstanding the pendency of any suit to recover a money judgment.
Section 9.3. Supplemental Enforcement of the Lien. In addition to the proceedings at law or in equity or the enforcement of the lien established by the condominium instruments or the Condominium Act, all of the unit owners may be required by the Declarant or the Board of Directors to execute bonds conditioned upon the faithful per­formance and payment of the installments of the lien established thereby and may likewise be required to secure the payment of such obligations by recording a declaration of trust in the land records where the condominium instruments are recorded granting unto one or more trustees appropriate powers to the end that, upon default in the performance of such bond such declaration of trust may be foreclosed by such trustees acting at the direction of the Board of Directors. If any such bonds have been executed and such decla­ration of trust is recorded, then any subsequent purchaser of a unit shall take title subject to such declaration of trust and shall assume the obligations provided for therein.
Section 9.4. Subordination and Mortgage Protection. Notwithstanding any other provisions to the contrary, the lien of any assessment levied pursuant to these Bylaws upon any unit (and any penalties, interest on assessments, late charges or the like) shall be subordinate to, and shall in no way affect the rights of a Mortgagee if the Mortgage was made in good faith for value received; provided, however, that such subordination shall apply only to assessments which have become due and payable prior to a sale or transfer of such unit pursuant to foreclosure, or any proceeding in lieu of foreclosure. Such sale or transfer shall not relieve the purchaser of the unit at such sale from liability for any assessments thereafter becoming due, nor from the lien of any such subsequent assessment, which lien shall have the same effect and be enforced in the same manner as provided herein.
