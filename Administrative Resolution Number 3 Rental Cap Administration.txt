Administrative Resolution Number 3
(Rental Cap Administration)
WHEREAS, Section 55-79.53 of the Virginia Condominium Act, Code of Virginia (1950, as amended) ("Act") and Article 9, Section 9.1 of the Bylaws of Stratford Condominium ("Bylaws") require that each owner, tenant, or occupant of a Unit comply with the Act, the condominium instruments (including the Declaration and Bylaws) and the rules and regulations of the Stratford Condominium Unit Owners Association ("Association"), as may be amended from time to time;
WHEREAS, Article 5, Section 5.8(b) of the Bylaws grants the Association's Board of Directors ("Board") the power to adopt and modify rules and regulations governing the use of units and common elements;
WHEREAS, Article 7 of the Declaration provides that: "At absolutely no time shall more than twenty percent (20%) of the units in the Condominium or more than twenty percent (20%) of the units in any building of the Condominium be leased unless an exception in writing is granted by the Board of Directors for good cause shown.";
WHEREAS, Article 7 of the Declaration also provides that: "Once the maximum number of units have been leased, Owners shall be allowed to lease their units as openings become available under the maximum on a first come, first served basis as logged on the Association's waiting list."; and
WHEREAS, the Board of Directors seeks to establish the procedures for the administration of the lease cap:
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY RESOLVED THAT:
(1)         Once twenty percent of the units at Stratford Condominium or in any building of the Condominium have been leased, no additional units may be leased at Stratford Condominium or the building in question until an opening becomes available.
(2)         There are 340 units at Stratford Condominium. Therefore, at no time may more than 68 units be rented anywhere in Stratford Condominium. As a mathematical matter, 20 % of the units in Building 1 (1860), Building 2 (11775), Building 3 (1855), and Building 4 (1851) equal 9.6, 9.6, 12.8, and 12 respectively. If these figures were rounded up, the total number of units would exceed the cap of 68 units. In order to preserve the 68 unit cap and to promote the most equitable solution, the Board of Directors has determined that those buildings that have already reached their 20% cap will have the cap rounded up and those that have not reached the cap will have their caps rounded down. The rental caps for Stratford Condominium are summarized in the table below:
Building Total No. Of Units No. Of Units That May Be Leased
Stratford House has 120 units, 24 of which may be leased.
Building 1 (1860) has 48 units, 10 of which may be leased.
Building 2 (11775) has 48 units, 9 of which may be leased.
Building 3 (1855) has 64 units, 13 of which may be leased.
Building 4 (1851) has 60 units, 12 of which may be leased.
(3)         There shall be a waiting list for each building. Owners who wish to lease their units must advise the Resident Manager in writing of their desire to be placed on the waiting list for the building in which their condominium unit is located. The Resident Manager shall place owners' names on the waiting list in the order in which owners submit their names for the waiting list. Owners who are not current in the payment of their condominium assessments, violation charges, or sums due to the Association, and any associated costs of collection or enforcement, shall not be eligible for placement on the waiting list. Owners who become more than 60 days delinquent in the payment of their condominium fees, violation charges or sums due to the Association, shall be subject to removal from the waiting list after notice and an opportunity for a hearing regarding their delinquency and their removal from the list.
(4)         When a unit is available for rental, the first person on the waiting list shall be notified by the Resident Manager in writing either by certified mail or by hand delivery. The owner then has 7 days from receipt of notification ( or 30 days from sending of notification, whichever occurs first) to advise the Resident Manager whether he or she wishes to lease their unit. If the owner elects to lease their unit, the owner shall have 90 days to do so. The 90 day period may be extended upon petition to the Board of Directors for good cause shown in the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. If an owner is not prepared or able to rent when notified of an opening, the Resident Manager will contact the next person on the waiting list to offer them an opportunity to rent under the same terms and conditions stated above. An owner who is offered an opportunity to rent and who declines the opportunity shall be moved to the bottom of the waiting list. Similarly, an owner who elects to rent but fails to secure a tenant within the allowed time shall be placed on the bottom of the waiting list.
(5)         Units that are currently being leased shall not be affected by the lease cap until ownership of the unit is transferred to a new owner. At that time, the unit must be sold or transferred to an owner who will occupy the unit if the maximum number of leased units has been reached in the building in which the unit is located. All owners who are leasing their units must provide the Resident Manager with a copy of the lease for each unit they are leasing.
(6)         The Board of Directors may provide limited exceptions from the lease cap in cases of extreme hardship. Whether a hardship warrants an exception is a matter to be determined on a case-by-case basis in the Board's sole discretion. In order to protect the integrity of the lease cap, such exceptions shall not be freely granted, and where granted they shall not exceed one year. If an owner is granted a hardship exception and the hardship exceeds one year, the owner receiving the exception must submit an application to the Board of Directors for renewal of the exception each year that the hardship continues. The Board of Directors may reject the renewal application or terminate the exception if the basis for the hardship no longer exists.
(7)         Without limiting any other remedies available to the Association under the governing documents of Stratford or at law, violators may be charged up to $50.00 for any violation and up to $ 10.00 per day for any continuing violation or such greater amounts as may be authorized by the Board of Directors and the Condominium Act. Any charges assessed for a violation of the Declaration, Bylaws or this rule, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, shall be reasonably related to the severity of the violation and shall be treated as an assessment against such unit owner's unit for which the Association shall have a lien against the unit. Such amounts also shall be the personal obligation of the unit owner, and where applicable, the tenant(s). The Board of Directors may also suspend a violating owner's and/or tenant's access to Association amenities including, without limitation, the swimming pools, exercise room, parking, etc. for violations of this Rule or the Declaration. In addition, the Association reserves the right to seek injunctive relief from the court to compel compliance with this Rule, the Declaration and/or the Bylaws. Such injunctive relief may include, without limitation, actions to void the lease and remove the tenants, or actions to force the sale of the unit to an occupying owner.
(8)         The offending owner, and/or the tenant of the unit in which that person resides shall be jointly and severally liable for all costs incurred by the Association to enforce this Rule the Association's Declaration and/or Bylaws, including court costs and reasonable attorney's fees.
(9)        This Resolution shall not be deemed to require a hearing prior to assessment of rules violation charges if a hearing is not requested or to prevent the Association from exercising any other remedies authorized or available under the Condominium Act, the Condominium Instruments or by law and shall not constitute an election of remedies.
(10)         In the event that any part or provision of this Resolution shall be adjudged unlawful or unenforceable under Virginia law, the remainder of this Resolution shall nonetheless survive and remain in full force and effect.
