Insurance
Section 6.1. Authority to Purchase: Notice. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.5, all insurance policies relating to the Property shall be purchased by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, the managing agent and the Declarant shall not be liable for failure to obtain any coverages required by this Article 6 or for any loss or damage resulting from such failure: 0) if such failure is due to the unavailability of such coverages from reputable insurance companies; (ii) if such coverages are so available only at demonstrably unreasonable cost; or (iii) if the Unit Owners Association's insurance professionals advise that the coverages required by paragraph (2) of Section 6.2(b) are not necessary. The Board of Directors shall promptly furnish to each unit owner written notice of the procurement of, subsequent changes in, or termination of, insurance coverages obtained on behalf of the Association, in compliance with section 55-79.81(b) of the Condominium Act.
(b)              Each such policy shall provide that:
(1)              The insurer waives any right to claim by way of subrogation against the Declarant, the Association, the Board of Directors, the managing agent or the unit owners, and their respective guests, invitees, tenants, agents and employees and, in the case of the unit owners, the members of their households;
(2)              Such policy shall not be cancelled, invalidated or suspended due to the conduct of any unit owner (including the members of such unit owner's household and such unit owner's guests, invitees, tenants, agents and employees) or of any member, officer or employee of the Board of Directors or the managing agent without a prior demand in writing that the Board or the managing agent cure the defect and neither shall have so cured such defect within sixty days after such demand; and
(3)              Such policy may not be cancelled or substantially modified (including cancellation for nonpayment of premium) without at least thirty days prior written notice to the Board of Directors, the managing agent and, as to liability insurance, flood insurance (if applicable), pressure, mechanical and electrical equipment including air conditioning equipment coverage and director's and officer's liability only, all Mortgagees.
(c)               The Declarant, so long as Declarant shall own any unit, shall be protected by all such policies as a unit owner. The coverage provided to the Declarant under the insurance policies obtained in compliance with this Article 6 shall not be deemed to protect or be for the benefit of any general contractor engaged by the Declarant nor shall such coverage be deemed to protect the Declarant against liability for (or waive any rights with respect to) warranty claims.
(d)              All policies of insurance shall be written by reputable companies licensed or qualified to do business in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Physical damage policies shall be in form and substance and with carriers acceptable to a majority of the Mortgagees.
(e)              The deductible, if any, on any insurance policy purchased by the of Directors shall be a common expense; provided, however, that the Association may, pursuant to Section 9.1 (a), assess any deductible amount necessitated by the act, neglect or carelessness for which a unit owner is responsible against such unit owner.
Section 6.2. Physical Damage Insurance. (a) The Board of Directors shall obtain and maintain a blanket policy of insurance against Special Causes of Loss (formerly "all-risk") insuring the entire Property (including without limitation all of the units and the fixtures initially installed therein by the Declarant, and replacements thereof up to the value of those initially installed by the Declarant, but not including furniture, wallcoverings, improvements and additions, furnishings or other personal property supplied or installed by unit owners}, together with all air conditioning and heating equipment and other service machinery contained therein and covering the interests of the Unit Owners Association, the Board of Directors and all unit owners and their Mortgagees, as their interests may appear, (subject, however, to the loss payment and adjustment provisions in favor of the insurance trustee}, in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the then current replacement cost of the Property (exclusive of the land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from such coverage), without deduction for depreciation (such amount to be redetermined annually by the Board with the assistance of the insurance company affording such coverage). The Board of Directors shall also obtain and maintain such coverage on all real and personal property owned by the Association.
(b)              Such policy shall also provide:
(1)              a waiver of any right of the insurer to repair, rebuild or replace any damage or destruction, if a decision is made pursuant to these Bylaws not to do so;
(2)              the following endorsements (or equivalent): (i) "no control" (to the effect that coverage shall not be prejudiced by any act or neglect of any occupant or unit owner or their agents when such act or neglect is not within the control of the insured, or the unit owners collectively; nor by any failure of the insured, or the unit owners collectively, to comply with any warranty or condition with regard to any portion of the Condominium over which the insured, or the unit owners collectively, have no control); (ii) "cost of demolition"; (iii) "contingent liability from operation of building laws or codes"; (iv) "increased cost of construction"; (v) "condominium replacement cost"; and (vi) "agreed amount" or elimination of coinsurance clause; and
(3)         That any "no other insurance" clause expressly exclude individual unit owners policies from its operation so that the physical damage policy purchased by the Board of Directors shall be deemed primary coverage and any individual unit owners' policies shall be deemed excess coverage, and in no event shall the insurance coverage obtained and maintained by the Board of Directors hereunder provide for or be brought into contribution with insurance purchased by individual unit owners or their Mortgagees, unless otherwise required by law.
 
(c)  A duplicate original of the policy of physical damage insurance, all renewals thereof, and any subpolicies or certificates and endorsements issued thereunder, together with proof of payment of premiums, shall be delivered by the insurer to any Mortgagee requesting the same, at least thirty days prior to expiration of the then current policy. Prior to obtaining any policy of physical damage insurance or any renewal thereof the Board of Directors shall obtain an appraisal from an insurance company, or such other source as the Board may determine, of the then current replacement cost of the Property, (exclusive of the land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from such coverage), without deduction for depreciation, for the purpose of determining the amount of physical damage insurance to be secured pursuant to this section. The Board of Directors shall promptly notify all Mortgagees of any event giving rise to a claim under such policy arising from damage to the common elements in excess of one percent of the then current replacement cost of the Property. The Board of Directors shall promptly notify the Mortgagee of a unit of any event giving rise to a claim under such policy arising from damage to such unit.
Section 6.3. Liability Insurance. The Board of Directors shall obtain and maintain comprehensive general _liability (including libel, slander, false arrest and invasion of privacy coverage) and property damage liability insurance in such limits as the Board may from time to time determine, insuring each director, the managing agent, each unit owner and the employees of the Unit Owners Association against any liability to the public or to the unit owners (and their guests, invitees, tenants, agents and employees) arising out of, or incident to the ownership or use of the common elements. Such insurance shall be issued on a comprehensive liability basis and shall contain: (i) a cross liability endorsement under which the rights of a named insured under the policy shall not be prejudiced with respect to an action against another named insured; (ii) hired and non-owned vehicle coverage; (iii) host liquor liability coverage with respect to events sponsored by the Association; (iv) deletion of the normal products exclusion with respect to events sponsored by the Association; and (v) a "severability of interest" endorsement which shall preclude the insurer from denying liability coverage to a unit owner because of negligent acts of the Association or of another unit owner. The Board of Directors shall review such limits once each year, but in no event shall such insurance be less than two million dollars covering all claims for bodily injury or property damage arising out of one occurrence. Reasonable amounts of "umbrella" liability insurance in excess of the primary limits shall also be obtained so that the total of the primary and excess limits are in an amount not less than five million dollars.
Section 6.4. Other Insurance. The Board of Directors shall obtain and maintain:
(a)              adequate fidelity coverage to protect against dishonest acts on the part of Officers, directors, trustees and employees of the Unit Owners Association and all others who handle, or are responsible for handling, funds of the Association, Including the managing agent. Such fidelity bonds shall: (i) name the Association as an obligee; (ii) be written in an amount not less than one-half the total annual condominium assessments for the year or the amount required by the Mortgagees, the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, whichever is greatest; and (iii) contain waivers of any defense based upon the exclusion of persons who serve without compensation from any definition of "employee" or similar expression;
(b)              if required by any governmental or quasi-governmental agency, including without limitation the Federal National Mortgage Association or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, flood insurance in accordance with the then applicable regulations of such agency;
(c)               workers' compensation insurance if and to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of law (including a voluntary employees endorsement and an "all states" endorsement);
(d)              if applicable, pressure, mechanical and electrical equipment including air conditioning equipment coverage on a comprehensive form in an amount not less than five hundred thousand dollars per accident per location;
(e)              directors and officers liability insurance in an amount not less than one million dollars; and
(f)               such other insurance as the Board of Directors may determine or as may be requested from time to time by a Majority Vote.
Section 6.5. Separate Insurance. Each unit owner shall have the right to obtain insurance for such unit owner's benefit, at such unit owner's expense, covering the unit and such unit owner's personal property and personal liability, as well as any improvements made to the unit by such unit owner (under coverage normally called "improvements and betterments coverage"); provided, however, that no unit owner shall be entitled to exercise this right to acquire or maintain such insurance coverage so as to decrease the amount which the Board of Directors, on behalf of all unit owners, may realize under any insurance policy maintained by the Board or to cause any, insurance coverage maintained by the Board to be brought into contribution with insurance coverage obtained by a unit owner. No unit owner shall obtain separate insurance policies on the Condominium except as provided in this section.
Section 6.6. Insurance Trustee. (a) All physical damage insurance policies purchased by the Board of Directors shall be for the benefit of the Unit Owners Association, the unit owners, their Mortgagees and the Declarant, as their interests may appear, and shall provide that all proceeds of such policies shall be paid in trust to the Board as "insurance trustee" to be applied pursuant to the terms of Article 7.
